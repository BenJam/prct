# TODO

## Pages

- many-to-many join (https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations/many-to-many-relations)
- query riderCount and 'me' / going
- login
- Join ride / unjoin ride (user can only add/remove themselves)
- remember user name (localStorage) - or require login?
- Should ride details be a new page? /ride/{id}

## Admin/Leader

- Add / edit ride form
- delete ride
- View of rides on calendar
- (https://github.com/moodydev/react-calendar/blob/master/src/components/Calendar.jsx)

## Engineering

- precommit hooks (test, check-types, lint)
- Add PWA manifest
- add long expiry to js,css,image assets on FB host
- Add tables to support multi-tenacy
